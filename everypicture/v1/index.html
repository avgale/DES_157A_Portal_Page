				<h3>My Story</h3>
				<p>I've always been a nature gal - what started off as playing in the sand and climbing trees has blossomed into a love of hiking, climbing, running, and overall just spending time outdoors. Each destination I've lived in has allowed me to explore new environments and nurture a deeper appreciation of nature.</p>

				<h3>Half Moon Bay, CA</h3>
				<p>From the ages of 8 to 16, I lived in the quaint coastal town of Half Moon Bay. Though I often took the beach for granted, I spent a lot of time watching sunsets through the cypresses and on the coastal trail. I also explored other parts of the bay area while living here.</p>

				<h3>Davis, CA</h3>
				<p>Though flatland, I have explore the few hiking trails in the vicinity of Davis. Due to the lack of mountainous terrain locally, my time in Davis has also led me to explore Lake Tahoe and other parts of the Sierras.</p>
