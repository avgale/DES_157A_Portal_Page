              <h3>Reflection: Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
              <p>When reading <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">this</a> article, I immediately resonated with the points brought up from the user’s perspective. I can easily recall many instances where I abandoned forms for many of the exact reasons listed in the article. It was surprising to me how many possible issues pop up in the context of forms, because I had never put much thought into them.</p>
              <br>
              <p>From a designer’s perspective, the visual depictions of each issue with the do/don’t images was very helpful in understanding how to approach forms as a designer. One point that stood out to me was the suggested specificity of error messages. Oftentimes, the underlying code does not support high specificity, and so it may be impossible for a designer to change this without changing the backend. Regardless, I will be consulting the article as a checklist when putting together my own forms.</p>
              <br>
              <p><a href="https://www.freetaxusa.com/">This</a> website, FreeTaxUA, is a prime example of a form that I find usable. When the user clicks start 2024 return, the form is broken down into many separate pages which make it less overwhelming. The full form pages are visible upon login or account creation.</p>

            <h3>Journal Entry 2</h3>
            <p> When reading the article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a>, I appreciated the author not only acknowledging the potential positive uses of overlays, but also providing basic guidelines to help differentiate what one should and shouldn’t do, as well as thinking critically about these guidelines. The “Who? What? When? Where? Why?” framework is an easy way to remember the different aspects to keep in mind, and splitting the article into these sections made it easy to follow. The abundance of visual examples was very helpful in understanding the issues brought to light by the author.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As someone who prioritizes responsive design, I was glad to see the point about the dangers of overlays on mobile devices, because this had not occurred to me before. I will be revisiting the article if I consider including an overlay in any of my future designs.</p>
